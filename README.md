# Attiny-Rc-switch-to-serial
I use this little Example to decrease interrupt firing with Rc-switch on Esp8266, needs only Hardware Serial.

Receive 433mhz Data on interrupt INT0 and put them out on Serial USI 9600 baud.

Created to decrease Interrupt Firing from RC-Switch Library on ESP8266.

Needs only 8pin Attiny45/85 without any Components.

On this way you can use HardwareSerial Buffer on ESP82266, in other ways you can use Tiny85 to Spam Filtering.
